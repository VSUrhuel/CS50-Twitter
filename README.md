# CS50's Twitter-like Project
The project idea is inspired by CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. 
It seems to be the first phase of the implementation, with some features followed and others not. 
The database used is Firebase, which differs from CS50's use of Django and Python for database management. 
Additionally, all files were coded from scratch and did not follow the provided pre-code of CS50.
